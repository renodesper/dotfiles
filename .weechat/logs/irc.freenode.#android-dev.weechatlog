2015-02-03 23:55:31	tx	justJanne:  Ah. I was wondering why the emulation was pretty great under Linux without it.

2015-02-03 23:56:21	_genuser_	thank you picasso for let me do picture loading myself.

2015-02-03 23:56:51	_genuser_	it's helping me learn some stuff, tho.
2015-02-03 23:57:07	justJanne	tx: Emulation is done with QEMU, which was uses KVM internally whenever possible, even allowsing native emulation on AMD processors, or even ARM processors ^^

2015-02-04 00:15:19	I440r	ugh. /dev/kvm is not in the kvm group
2015-02-04 00:15:38	justJanne	chown root:kvm /dev/kvm
2015-02-04 00:15:38	justJanne	chmod g+rw /dev/kvm
2015-02-04 00:15:44	_genuser_	argh, anybody remember when rfc's used to be free...
2015-02-04 00:16:04	I440r	justJanne, i know how :)
2015-02-04 00:16:18	I440r	rfc's arent free any more?
2015-02-04 00:16:22	I440r	request for PAID comments?
2015-02-04 00:17:05	_genuser_	iso.org charges money for downloading the final copy. I think for some you can still get the "non-final" version for free. but you don't what teh difference is in the finalized standard.
2015-02-04 00:17:33	mYd1	Guys i have big problem with my android app! i lost my keystore is it possible to keep the same url name in playstore if i build the same app aigan? and upload these ...

2015-02-04 00:18:11	justJanne	mYd1: not really. Without the keystore, the android OS won’t allow users that had the app installed before to update it,

2015-02-04 00:18:25	justJanne	therefore I think the playstore also forbids changing the signing key.
