So something a long the lines of creating a document, having the user sign that document, then updating a database table entry that they have completed it. Django-docusign unfortunately does not have support for 1.7 or 1.8. Has anyone done anything like this or have any recommendations?

The makemigrations detects the change but wants a default value for the new pk field.  I'm not sure how to set the default value for the pk field to get unique integers

2015-06-18 00:37:33	ocelot	ghing: I think what you need is to write a data migration https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/topics/migrations/#data-migrations
2015-06-18 00:37:36	underthehill	ghing: you‚Äôll probably need to do a data migration first, making a unique int column and populating it with values, then remove the primary_key property from the SlugField and apply it to the new column you generated in the data migration, then delete the SlugField
2015-06-18 00:38:03	ocelot	^ precisely that
2015-06-18 00:38:21	ghing	Thanks. That makes sense.  I think I'm early enough along that I can just update the model and recreate the migrations
2015-06-18 00:38:30	ghing	because the data migrations for the relations will be hard
2015-06-18 00:38:38	ghing	and ugly
2015-06-18 00:38:56	underthehill	yes, if you have any ForeignKey or M2M relationships, they‚Äôll be wicked hard.
2015-06-18 00:39:05	ghing	This isn't in production yet, so I think it might be better to do it the right way and clobber the migration history

2015-06-18 01:04:24	alayek	I am using Djago 1.8.2 with Python 2.7.8
2015-06-18 01:04:32	frostym	what's your question?
2015-06-18 01:04:49	WeiJunLi	frostym, thanks ;)
2015-06-18 01:05:01	alayek	Ok, I added the custom method def was_published_recently(self): 		return self.pub_date >= timezone.now() - datetime.timedelta(days=1)
2015-06-18 01:05:08	alayek	In the Model
2015-06-18 01:05:09	-->	xterm has joined #django
2015-06-18 01:05:11	alayek	Question
2015-06-18 01:05:18	alayek	Let me share the code snippet
2015-06-18 01:05:21	frostym	WeiJunLi: np

2015-06-18 01:06:18	alayek	I am using Sublime text
2015-06-18 01:06:24	-->	gbazilio has joined #django
2015-06-18 01:06:33	alayek	I ensured all spaces are replaced by tabs
2015-06-18 01:06:48	alayek	But when I try to access the custom method from Interactive shell
2015-06-18 01:06:52	<--	gbazilio has left #django
2015-06-18 01:06:56	alayek	I am getting AttributeError
2015-06-18 01:07:00	-->	maugzoide has joined #django
2015-06-18 01:07:05	alayek	Traceback (most recent call last):   File "<console>", line 1, in <module> AttributeError: 'QuerySet' object has no attribute 'was_published_recently'
2015-06-18 01:07:10	nedbat	alayek: fwiw, spaces are a better idea than tabs...
2015-06-18 01:07:13	alayek	I Googled this error
2015-06-18 01:07:13	frostym	How are you accessing it?
2015-06-18 01:07:23	maugzoide	is ok to use transaction.atomic decorator on top of form_valid?
2015-06-18 01:07:29	alayek	I found one thread of stackoverflow
2015-06-18 01:07:31	-->	infecto has joined #django
2015-06-18 01:07:36	alayek	Had the same error
2015-06-18 01:07:37	-->	jef79m has joined #django
2015-06-18 01:07:50	alayek	And the suggestion was exactly what you guys are telling me
2015-06-18 01:07:56	alayek	I replaced them with spaces
2015-06-18 01:07:59	alayek	But not working
2015-06-18 01:08:10	alayek	Should I replace all tabs in the file with spaces?
2015-06-18 01:08:18	nedbat	alayek: can you pastebin the code that uses the attribute, and the full error report?
2015-06-18 01:08:19	frostym	how are you calling was_published_recently()?
2015-06-18 01:08:27	alayek	ok
2015-06-18 01:08:34	nedbat	alayek: spaces are better than tabs, but might not be your problem.
2015-06-18 01:08:57	Fuyou	it's very likely unrelated
2015-06-18 01:09:02	alayek	frostym: I am accessing it from Interactive shell (python manage.py shell)
2015-06-18 01:09:05	-->	sohrab has joined #django
2015-06-18 01:09:11	Fuyou	There is an eror for wrong identiation
2015-06-18 01:09:12	alayek	Then I get a question object
2015-06-18 01:09:14	frostym	alayek: I mean what's the line you typed in
2015-06-18 01:09:27	alayek	q.was_published_recently()
2015-06-18 01:09:35	frostym	alayek: How do you define q?
2015-06-18 01:09:59	nedbat	alayek: did you restart your shell after adding was_published_recently to your model?
2015-06-18 01:10:01	alayek	q =  Question.objects.filter(id=1)
2015-06-18 01:10:08	alayek	And q is not []
2015-06-18 01:10:11	alayek	I checked
2015-06-18 01:10:11	frostym	filter returns a queryset, use get
2015-06-18 01:10:15	frostym	Question.objects.get(id=1)
2015-06-18 01:10:17	sohrab	how do you all manage environmental variables between projects when you're developing? i'm using dj-database-url and need to set env var DATABASE_URL
2015-06-18 01:10:23	alayek	ohh...ok
2015-06-18 01:10:26	alayek	Let me try then
2015-06-18 01:10:36	alayek	How to access it using get()?
2015-06-18 01:10:52	frostym	Question.objects.get(id=1).was_published_recently()
2015-06-18 01:11:03	alayek	alright
2015-06-18 01:11:12	frostym	You'll get a Question.DoesNotExist exception if it doesn't exist in the DB though
2015-06-18 01:11:38	alayek	Huh!
2015-06-18 01:11:39	alayek	This works!!
2015-06-18 01:11:46	-->	spaes has joined #django
2015-06-18 01:11:49	alayek	I am getting expected result
2015-06-18 01:11:52	alayek	Thanks frostym
2015-06-18 01:12:06	frostym	np
2015-06-18 01:12:14	alayek	But why was the custom method not working on QuerySet?
2015-06-18 01:12:31	Fuyou	because it's not q queryset method
2015-06-18 01:12:31	alayek	Would it have worked if I had accessed it individually?
2015-06-18 01:12:48	frostym	Filter returns a queryset, which evaluates to a list of results when you iterate over it
2015-06-18 01:12:55	frostym	get makes it return a single result and fails if it doesn't
2015-06-18 01:13:03	frostym	here are the docs for queryset: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/ref/models/querysets/
2015-06-18 01:13:11	alayek	yes, it works if I get the QuerySet, access its element and then run it
2015-06-18 01:13:14	alayek	Thanks guys
2015-06-18 01:13:21	-->	jiang42 has joined #django
2015-06-18 01:13:23	alayek	ohh...
2015-06-18 01:13:36	alayek	So get() is the ORM equivalent of limit 1?
2015-06-18 01:13:47	shangxiao	sohrab: if apache then it's a bit wonky
2015-06-18 01:14:13	shangxiao	sohrab: do you mean in production or development?
2015-06-18 01:14:21	frostym	that would probably be closer to Question.objects.filter(id=1)[:1], get() is for retrieving when you know it will have a single result and you don't want a list back
2015-06-18 01:14:34	alayek	hmm...ok.
2015-06-18 01:14:38	-->	AimerPaddle has joined #django
2015-06-18 01:15:10	alayek	I am just a beginner in Django. I use get on key-value pairs to handle the KeyError
2015-06-18 01:15:19	WeiJunLi	frostym, I can add a label like widgtes = {'name': forms.Textarea(), label{'enter your name''}} right?
2015-06-18 01:15:21	sohrab	shangxiao: in development.
2015-06-18 01:15:38	shangxiao	dj_database_url has a default parameter you can use
2015-06-18 01:15:47	frostym	WeiJunLi: I'm pretty sure you have to set the label in the __init__ method like self.fields['myfield'].label = 'LABEL'
2015-06-18 01:15:50	shangxiao	otherwiser you can just export your env var in your shell
2015-06-18 01:16:12	frostym	WeiJunLi: AFTER you call super
2015-06-18 01:16:30	sohrab	shangxiao: but what about if i want to develop 2 different projects at the same time? will i need to manually change the variable when i switch between them?

2015-06-18 01:17:00	-->	foxmask has joined #django
2015-06-18 01:17:03	shangxiao	sohrab: just use the default parameter
2015-06-18 01:17:17	shangxiao	dj_database_url.config(default='your-dev-url')
2015-06-18 01:17:21	shangxiao	something like that
2015-06-18 01:17:45	WeiJunLi	frostym, where I need to call super on my modelform?
2015-06-18 01:18:07	<--	jiang42 has quit (Ping timeout: 244 seconds)
2015-06-18 01:18:30	frostym	In __init__ before you set the label call super(MyModelFormName, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)
2015-06-18 01:19:05	sohrab	shangxiao: okay. i can list the value in 'your-dev-url', right? ignore the environmental variable for development?

2015-06-18 01:20:13	shangxiao	sohrab: yes, that's what default means ;)

2015-06-18 01:37:42	crowbar	Anyone familiar with django-rq and rq know how to set a timeout for time spent sitting in the queue, rather than for once it actually starts running?  I'd like jobs to age off the queue if it takes too long to get to them.

2015-06-18 01:42:37	frostym	crowbar: I've never worked with django-rq (or rq for that matter) but you could create a simple class that marks a timestamp on instantiation then the queue calls a method on that that would only execute if the time delta is small enough
2015-06-18 01:42:52	frostym	crowbar: It wouldn't remove them from the queue but it'd skip them if it took too long which, imo, would be effectively the same
2015-06-18 01:44:13	crowbar	thanks, still nee to purge them eventually or the queue would grow indefinitely.   I did find what i needed in rq.  I need to set 'ttl', not 'timeout'
2015-06-18 01:44:53	crowbar	just have to figure out how to get django-rq to pass that on :)

2015-06-18 01:50:12	WeiJunLi	frostym,  on the views I have a success_url

2015-06-18 23:22:18	tsura	hi all - I am trying to write an UpdateView to update Users. I have an update form which only edits the users username and email. I can navigate to the update view to load a specific user details through a pk in the URL. However, when I submit the update form, it takes me to a URL without the PK (which I do not have in my urls.py) and I get a 404.
2015-06-18 23:23:03	tsura	does anyone have any idea on what this might be? the action for the form is "." which, as far as I understand, should go to the URL that the user is currently on (with the PK)

On the other hand, virtualenv is *vital* for local dev since you can be working on multiple projects at any given time, all with different deps and versions of those deps

2015-06-19 00:36:53	thunderbolt	Basically I want tagging and content "templates". I currently have a homemade CMS that has a hierarchical categorization system.
2015-06-19 00:37:11	Melamo	lwm48: virtualenv basically just creates a local directory to install python libs to (as opposed to the system python lib dir). It uses some symlink tricks + a bash script to setup your terminal env such that the python paths point to the virtualenv dir instead of the system dir. That way when you pip install something, it goes to that folder you made, that you have complete permissions over (e.g. you don‚Äôt need root to inst

2015-06-19 00:38:14	tbaxter	CrowX-: Ok, split the list part of your view out into a sub-template that you include. Then, in your view, add a request.is_ajax() check. If true, then return just that snippet and have the JS insert the new version. Overall pages stays same, list gets replaced.

For isntance, type ‚Äúwhich python‚Äù and look at the path the python executable is located. Then activate a virtual env and type that command again. Notice it will now point to the virtualenv dir

2015-06-19 00:55:16	CrowX-	tbaxter, I meant something like the js sending one ajax call that would wait and not return anything until a new object is entered

2015-06-21 01:01:07	jessamynsmith	it's a custom serializer, which you would then use in your drf setup
2015-06-21 01:01:52	erickit	Yah, I have a working way.  I just want to override a pre_Save hook for the imageField.  I feel like that‚Äôd be cleaner‚Ä¶ if you have any info on that let me know, otherwise I‚Äôll keep pressing.
2015-06-21 01:02:14	jessamynsmith	so, a pre_save is more global, but perhaps unnecessary
2015-06-21 01:02:20	erickit	Yah..

2015-06-21 01:46:05	organman91	Hi all, migrating from Django 1.7 to 1.8, trying to remove some deprecation warnings
2015-06-21 01:46:23	organman91	in my admin.py I'm trying to import a model from another app: https://dpaste.de/gkQo
2015-06-21 01:46:47	jessamynsmith	Brachamul: kind of... if the list has ids, you could query the database object for those ids
2015-06-21 01:46:51	organman91	but doing so yields this: Model class base.models.Participant doesn't declare an explicit app_label and either isn't in an application in INSTALLED_APPS or else was imported before its application was loaded. This will no longer be supported in Django 1.9.
2015-06-21 01:47:04	jessamynsmith	but it's generally better to do all your queryset manipulation first, then create a list if need be
2015-06-21 01:47:30	organman91	(for reference, the "base" application IS in installed_apps)

2015-06-21 01:52:55	organman91	going off of advice from stackoverflow et al
2015-06-21 01:52:55	ubsrv	hi, I have an admin action with an intermediate page with a template which is passed the queryset; however, once the user confirmed the action, when the admin action function is called again, the queryset parameter is empty. What may be causing this?
2015-06-21 01:53:01	organman91	the custom app is listed last
2015-06-21 01:53:18	jessamynsmith	organman91: and just to verify, this admin, is it in that same app, or another?
2015-06-21 01:53:34	organman91	the admin.py is in a different app
2015-06-21 01:53:54	jessamynsmith	so the base app has to be in INSTALLED_APPS before the one that uses it
2015-06-21 01:54:09	jessamynsmith	I think, anyway
2015-06-21 01:54:39	organman91	that creates more deprecation warning
2015-06-21 01:54:47	jessamynsmith	awesome
2015-06-21 01:54:50	organman91	with that app last only 3 are emitted
2015-06-21 01:54:58	jessamynsmith	what are the other deprecation warnings?
2015-06-21 01:55:06	jessamynsmith	fundamentally, you don't want circular dependencies
2015-06-21 01:55:30	jessamynsmith	if it's unavoidable, then I think you are stuck doing this: http://stackoverflow.com/a/29703136/1649165
2015-06-21 01:55:36	organman91	it's all the same warning, just for different modles

2015-06-21 01:55:38	jessamynsmith	i.e. the get_model thing
2015-06-21 01:56:43	organman91	hmm
2015-06-21 01:56:52	organman91	so
2015-06-21 01:56:55	jessamynsmith	hard to say without seeing your entire setup, but it sounds like you may have circular references/dependencies

2015-06-21 02:14:09	organman91	thanks for your help

2015-06-21 03:06:46	sudomarize	would you guys suggest using DO (+ something like dokku) or heroku for deploying my django app?

2015-06-21 03:07:22	jessamynsmith	for my personal projects, it's great
2015-06-21 03:07:23	sudomarize	i.e. gets expensive as you scale
2015-06-21 03:07:31	jessamynsmith	if you're very busy, yeah, it gets expensive
2015-06-21 03:07:54	jessamynsmith	I used it at my last workplace, as we were a relatively low traffic site without huge data

2015-06-21 03:12:49	mattmcc	At $5/mo for 512mb, DO is a pretty easy choice.
2015-06-21 03:13:11	moldy	what is DO?
2015-06-21 03:13:13	sudomarize	jessamynsmith, phildini, moldy: so go with DO then? devops shouldn't be that much more complex, and the price point that DO is selling is pretty appealing

2015-06-21 03:13:46	mattmcc	Though for almost any of their larger plans, Linode gives better disk/transfer.
2015-06-21 03:14:02	sudomarize	i did see a shell script that apparently managed auto scaling for you actually
2015-06-21 03:14:08	mattmcc	sudomarize: That really depends on your app.
2015-06-21 03:14:15	phildini	sudomarize: My _preference_ is for digital ocean, but YMMV. I should note I used to use heroku exclusively, but I don't know where I fit in their new pricing.

2015-06-21 03:14:46	moldy	organman91: yes, so what? you can use "yourapp.auth.MyBackend" for that setting

2015-06-22 20:16:50	QuestPC	Hi! How do I debug django.admin? I made some changes to models and now when I try to add new model in django.admin, it redirects to django.admin login page instead of creating model. It used to work but stopped at some time. I tried to drop database and reissue all migrations, it did not help.
2015-06-22 20:16:50	Andy80	shangxiao knbk I didn't create the backup.... but I restored it with: pg_restore -U myuser -d mydb -Fc mybakcup.backup
2015-06-22 20:17:03	daGrevis	hi! is there a way to print timestamp for each line I get when running tests with verbose arg?
2015-06-22 20:17:16	moldy	QuestPC: with a debugger ;)

2015-06-22 20:20:00	QuestPC	moldy: Because it's really strange. I did not alter django.admin code just changed admin class a bit and models a bit. Redirects looks like logouts, like protection from security breach maybe. They are very strange in django.admin. I do not override a lot in django.admin

2015-06-22 20:22:36	moldy	QuestPC: python 3.4 and ubuntu 14.04 are fine. it is most likely a problem with your code. if you show us the code, maybe we can spot it.
2015-06-22 20:22:44	knbk	that¬¥s by far the easiest solution

2015-06-22 20:35:18	moldy	QuestPC: hmm, i don't spot a problem there. i'd use pdb to track it down.
2015-06-22 20:35:36	Andy80	what surprises me is that South itself is using migrations... I did remember South didn't use migrations
2015-06-22 20:35:44	moldy	justanomad: did you check what the error message suggests?

2015-06-22 21:39:45	moldy	does your code actually use 5 databases at the same time, or are you just checking for compatibility to 5 different databases?

2015-06-22 21:45:44	moldy	if it's an external service you get data from, that's a classic usecase for mocking, imho.

2015-06-22 22:27:16	bradfordli123	I am creating a photo galleries and I would like thumbnails for each gallery. Not quite sure how to serve this thumbnail in the fastest way. Would it be better to create a thumbnail on page load, or have the thumbnail created before hand and have it stored somewhere to be retrieved?
2015-06-22 22:28:30	bk_0	moldy: OK. I think the issue might be that some lists contain no elements. Is there a way to fail gracefully in that case?

Both X and Y have migrations. There is another app, installed with PIP, Z, which also has migrations. Models in Y extend models in Z. Now, when coming to syncdb or migrate, I get the following error:
2015-06-22 23:54:43	[bma]	"django.db.migrations.state.InvalidBasesError: Cannot resolve bases for <all models in Y>" and Y is listed at the top as an unmigrated app to Sync. The error says "This can happen if you are inheriting models from an app with migrations (e.g. contrib.auth) in an app with no migrations" - but everything has migrations. I've been struggling with this for hours and cannot find a
2015-06-22 23:54:43	[bma]	solution - any ideas?

2015-06-22 23:56:30	[bma]	Also - if I remove app Y from installed apps, migrate, then re-add Y to installed apps and sync again, it works - but that isn't a feasible solution in the automation workflow we need.

2015-06-23 00:22:31	anth0ny	holler: I've never used docker, but I believe you would then just type the same command that you would use to get into the django shell on your own machine
2015-06-23 00:22:45	doismellburning	holler: same as you would without Docker
2015-06-23 00:22:47	holler	anth0ny: ya doesnt work

2015-06-23 00:26:06	doismellburning	holler: if your project is called `app`, then you want `app.settings`
2015-06-23 00:26:15	doismellburning	holler: but seeing a full directory tree would be helpful
2015-06-23 00:26:26	-->	heyts has joined #django

2015-06-23 00:27:27	holler	ah! anth0ny: that worked

2015-07-09 00:49:08	moldy	an alternative would be to us a callable for upload_to and have the callable check type(instance) or such
2015-07-09 00:49:13	moldy	*use a callable
2015-07-09 00:49:24	moldy	but imho it's cleaner not to do that

2015-07-29 22:19:45	shangxiao	Hydhen: as long as you're aware the postgres is a superior database ;)
2015-07-29 22:19:48	chachan	Hydhen, it¬¥s not so hard to start with PostgrSQL, the hard part is SQL and that you might already know
2015-07-29 22:20:22	ironfroggy	Hydhen: so why are you creating the databse outside django at all then?

2015-07-29 22:21:38	chachan	mekhami, you don¬¥t need that, pk is already recognizes as the id. I mean, don¬¥t override that method just to do that
