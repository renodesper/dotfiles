2013-08-17 10:56:43	Lordveda	What could be the cause of this?

2013-08-17 12:33:49	Apsu	Well, slightly more cases.
2013-08-17 12:33:52	Apsu	So, to be clear
2013-08-17 12:34:22	belak	I've been having issues with the wpa_supplicant init script... http://pastie.org/8244313 All that makes sense, but when I checked dmesg, it said "systemd-udevd[159]: error changing net interface name wlan0 to wlp7s0: Device or resource busy" This was after disabling wpa_supplicant at boot and restarting...

2013-08-17 12:34:27	belak	Any ideas?

2013-08-17 12:34:54	Apsu	kristof: netfilter -- as seen through iptables -- has multiple tables, and chains in each table. The default table is "filter". It has INPUT, FORWARD, and OUTPUT chains.
2013-08-17 12:35:11	-->	kerrick has joined #archlinux
2013-08-17 12:35:25	Apsu	kristof: INPUT is purely for traffic destined to an IP actually on the box. FORWARD purely for traffic being routed through. OUTPUT purely for traffic originating from the box.

2013-08-17 12:36:28	Apsu	kristof: So the first big caveat with OUTPUT filtering is that traffic in response to talking to the firewall itself needs to be allowed/filtered carefully. Real easy way to lock yourself out :)
2013-08-17 12:36:46	Apsu	kristof: FORWARD is more explicitly for trusted/untrusted traffic on either side, passing through.

2013-09-29 18:24:36	FernandoBasso	I am reading https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Acpid but can't figure out the name of the volume keys.

2013-11-05 16:17:52	keenerd	All it says about creating a user is "Add any user accounts you require besides root, as described in User management. It is not good practice to use the root account for regular use, or expose it via SSH on a server. The root account should only be used for administrative tasks."
2013-11-05 16:17:54	flugsio	It has a link

2014-01-01 20:37:05	magneticduck	there is a config file for termite where you can define colors from color1 to color256

2014-01-01 20:38:38	magneticduck	also, I see a lot of people maing color schemes in .Xsettings -- what does that work for?

2014-01-01 20:45:46	magneticduck	but two things: I don't really understand how those colors are organized (by what logic the programs choose which color number they will use for background / accent / content light etc)

2014-09-25 20:14:08	Earnestly	neutrino: Pentadactyl is designed to more fully emulate a vim-like experience, Vimperator just wants to layer on some basic vim-like functionality while still using most of the normal Firefox UI
2014-09-25 20:14:20	xkonni	neutrino: its not. it can't be. blame chromium
2014-09-25 20:14:26	TheLemonMan	nope, it's not configurable at all atm

2014-09-25 20:14:45	TheLemonMan	but the devs are working on that, at least that's what they say
2014-09-25 20:14:47	neutrino	bah ! not good enough
2014-09-25 20:15:06	Earnestly	Pentadactyl and Vimperator allows me to easily add custom hints that run custom javascript to do basically whatever I want.

2014-11-09 21:03:22	sudokode	fdisk just identifies the partition type flag... it's not necessarily necessary

2014-11-30 16:24:32	reimorster	i have installed arch to a btrfs partitioned drive (two parts, one for rootfs and one for homefs), syslinux bios (its an old laptop, sirca 2010). After a pacman Syu in which the kernel was upgraded (i think to 3.17 or so..) the system never booted again giving a 'the filesystem is compressed' cannot load kernel/ramfs.. something like that. Then after several trials I gave up and with the help of a archiso I archrooted to the fs and installed 
2014-11-30 16:24:33	reimorster	linux-lts. It then returned to boot up and I am stuck with linux-lts. Is there any problem with btrfs root/syslinux/bios combination with the recent kernels?

2014-11-30 17:29:17	friden	nice, lots of people here. im trying out arch for first time and figured i'd make a bootable usb with persistency. booted it, partitioned some space on it once i got up and running, mounted the new partition in /mnt, did arch-chroot, configured fstab (but fucked it up). now after reboot i can't mount my new sdx since my fstab in there is broken. is there a way to edit it from outside the sdx without mounting it?
2014-11-30 17:29:26	davine	Didn't know, vklm, thanks ;).

2014-11-30 17:35:29	JohnBobSmith	what?!
2014-11-30 17:35:36	JohnBobSmith	I'm using a 32 bit PC right now
2014-11-30 17:35:55	daria	same here
2014-11-30 17:35:55	JohnBobSmith	Maybe when 128 bit holographic PC's come out, then we can drop 32 bit.
2014-11-30 17:35:57	davine	jelle, isn't that what I said? xD
2014-11-30 17:35:57	wasamasa	JohnBobSmith: simple, to support 32bit packages arch needs developers with 32bit installs that can test and sign them off
2014-11-30 17:36:09	wasamasa	JohnBobSmith: there's like, two of them
2014-11-30 17:36:17	JohnBobSmith	well, I could make 3.
2014-11-30 17:36:21	JohnBobSmith	once I learn the ropes of arch
2014-11-30 17:36:25	jelle	JohnBobSmith: I don't think that any of the current arch devs except a few have i686 hardware
2014-11-30 17:36:49	wasamasa	(according to a very interesting froscon talk about arch development)
2014-11-30 17:36:50	daria	windows 3.11 used to have limited 32 bit support despite being a 16-bit OS, do you think there will be something like that, 64-bit emulation for 32-bit architectures?
2014-11-30 17:36:51	-->	matheus23 has joined #archlinux
2014-11-30 17:37:00	honestly	all of that amd64 hardware can still run in 32bit mode...
2014-11-30 17:37:17	wasamasa	and this is already stalling their releases
2014-11-30 17:37:20	honestly	hardware is not the problem with regards to testing
2014-11-30 17:37:40	wasamasa	so it's not that surprising that if the devs decide to no longer support 32bit because it's too much of a pain, it might happen soonish

2014-11-30 17:39:03	reimorster	the software for 32bit can run on 64 because the opcodes for long register operations are marked with a prefix REX.. which is not used on 32bit binaries.

2014-11-30 17:53:00	reimorster	I waste so much time on random stuff that using a mouse is not the greatest time-taker i have to deal with. so editors with or without mouse support are not my concern.
2014-11-30 17:53:22	JohnBobSmith	ridicule777: Make sure your grub.cfg is actually named grub.cfg and not gub.cfg (what I did by mistake) or grub.cfg.new

2014-12-15 22:21:49	mk2soldier	I've installed Arch Linux following almost to the letter the beginner's guide, however when the system boots I get those messages in the console (before the login prompt) http://pastebin.com/CyaLxdBr and then I get those messages http://pastebin.com/LK1xpAvw, my system after the second series of messages become inusable. I have to keep pressed the power button to shut down the machine. What could be causing this major issue?

Currently I'm using the nvidia-340xx for a gfource model in an iMac 2009 model. I can't see any console windows when  press alt-f2 from x. If I sue the nouveau driver i can see them ,but x reports no screens found and doesn't start.

2014-12-20 22:24:31	grawity	vaskozl: depends on what your 'average user' runs, really
2014-12-20 22:24:49	grawity	vaskozl: like, on Arch, the average user might run ntpd or mpd or a webserver or Samba
2014-12-20 22:24:50	berceanu_	Mion: let alone the arch one. so if i reboot at this point i will not be able to enter any of my OSes
2014-12-20 22:24:53	Mion	vaskozl: specially if the user visits random wifi networks
2014-12-20 22:24:59	grawity	vaskozl: you definitely want to firewall Samba, for example

2014-12-20 22:25:51	ooesili	vaskozl: if it binds only to 127.0.0.1, then you don't need to block it in your firewall.

2014-12-20 22:29:23	thrice	fedora does it nicely, where they have a gummiboot snippet that just gets filled in with the kernel version
2014-12-20 22:29:36	grawity	vaskozl: so you should first scan your *local* address, from another PC in the same LAN

2014-12-24 12:51:49	KlipKyle	The problem with passive snooping of Wifi is that most people don't realize they are (metaphorically) nude in public.

I unplugged the drive and plugged it back in(typical way to fix things, and I also completely forgot about umount). Needless to say, the drive no longer appears when I fdisk. Any ideas?

2015-01-01 09:38:06	--	SoniEx2 is now known as Soni
2015-01-01 09:38:11	d_garbage	jantman, yaourt is a 3'rd party, unsupported script that wraps pacman and makepkg. Use it with that in mind
2015-01-01 09:38:12	Earnestly	jantman: yaourt is untrusted, unvetted user uploaded content
2015-01-01 09:38:19	rwiggins	jantman: I trust random yum or PPAs or whatnot about as much as I trust the AUR

2015-01-01 09:41:17	demize	Earnestly: :D
2015-01-01 09:41:19	rwiggins	it's just that for one-off things, the AUR tends to be the way folks go
2015-01-01 09:41:23	Earnestly	jantman: Where as Core/Extra/Community are actual repos, it's not like yum/ppa
2015-01-01 09:41:28	-->	Corey84 has joined #archlinux
2015-01-01 09:41:36	jantman	so (1) the only Right way of using AUR things is makepkg as an untrusted user, and then pacman to install the package; (2) there's no officially supported and widely-used way of getting prebuilt packages via pacman?

2015-01-01 09:42:00	d1str0	holomorph: does that help?
2015-01-01 09:42:33	jantman	so the stuff that's in AUR and not in Extra/Community is just... lazyness? nobody willing to be an official maintainer?
2015-01-01 09:42:35	demize	jantman: 1) "untrusted"? non-root at least. 2) For the AUR, no.
2015-01-01 09:42:37	rwiggins	jantman: Well, there are the official Arch repos (like [core], [extra], [community]) for pre-built packages. That way is officially-supported and widely-used. 
2015-01-01 09:42:58	rwiggins	And there are some repos that contain useful stuff, like that one haskell repo
2015-01-01 09:42:59	demize	jantman: The Arch devs/TUs maintains what they want to maintain, nothing more nothing less.
2015-01-01 09:43:07	Earnestly	jantman: Imo, don't use the AUR.  You can use it as a starting point, but then you keep the build files (PKGBUILD) and make sure they're correct, then you'd just maintain them locally and use a local repo instead.
2015-01-01 09:43:12	averell	why is yaourt not part of that? it obviously adds value people want

2015-01-01 09:54:40	Earnestly	jantman: I'm a terrible maintainer, some of my packages even depend on dirty build environments, once you've got the pkgbuild actually updating is effortless mostly because pkgver() does it for me.  I'm very lazy
2015-01-01 09:55:12	jantman	ok, cool. so... I guess I'll have to be auditing the stuff I've been running from AUR....

2015-01-01 09:57:00	jantman	Earnestly: I haven't. when I started using arch - was introduced to it by a friend - the intro I got was essentially "search for something on AUR and use yaourt to install it"

He talked mostly about only focusing on the emails you care about (which isn't totally obvious, i.e. "important" is not useful).  It kind of struck a chord in a general sense.

When I try to start spotify through the i3-dmenu-desktop dmenu wrapper of i3 it doesn't, nothing happens, but it works fine when starting through the terminal.

I have never messed with the go program before, but I've run across the jobber package on this website: http://www.maketecheasier.com/cron-alternatives-linux/ and want to install it.  I have installed go, but I don't understand what I should put for 'cd /path/to/your/go/workspace' I went to github.com and downloaded the zip file.  When I try the 'make -C src/github.com/dshearer/jobber' I get the error: 'ma
2015-02-03 23:30:18	bluesfreak72	ke: *** src/github.com/dshearer/jobber: No such file or directory.  Stop.'  Should I move the jobber-master directory to /usr???  Help please!!!

There are a

When using the iGPU in the xorg.conf xorg starts like it should and everything works fine. But when I try to use the dGPU with the nvidia driver xorg starts and runs in the background but it doesnt show up on the screen, there is only the unresponsive command line. But when I open a terminal with

2015-06-23 02:54:20	Earnestly	alad: My opinion is, if you're going to use c89, use it, don't make stupid typedefs because someone might want to use fixed types

2015-06-23 03:00:19	Earnestly	n-iCe: You have to switch to the hdmi profile, or make it autoswitch on connect.
2015-06-23 03:00:28	@MrElendig	n-iCe: depends on your hardware
2015-06-23 03:00:34	n-iCe	I have earnestly but no sound
2015-06-23 03:00:44	@MrElendig	n-iCe: for most, just select hdmi out in your favorite pulseaudio mixer
