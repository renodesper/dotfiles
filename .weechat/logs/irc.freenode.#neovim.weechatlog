2014-04-18 21:51:20	frew	tarruda: not sure if anyone else has mentioned, but you haven't actually fulfilled the rewards; for one my Bounysource username is just a quarter of my name, and on top of that more than 150 people expect a URL in the backers.md, me included
2014-04-18 21:52:08	tarruda	frew: you are right
2014-04-18 21:52:45	tarruda	the problem is that bountysource just gave me that information, is your url set in the bountysource account?
2014-04-18 21:53:03	frew	tarruda: I thought so but I can't tell from the UI
2014-04-18 21:53:05	renodesper	Hi, I just recently using vim and found out about neovim. If I want to switch into neovim, will my vimrc and plugins still work?
2014-04-18 21:53:29	frew	tarruda: I can tell you the info for myself, but I suspect that if this has to happen via word of mouth you have a long, frustrating road ahead of you :/
2014-04-18 21:53:40	frew	renodesper: not yet, many plugins are broken right now
2014-04-18 21:53:56	tarruda	frew: I'm gonna contact bountysource regarding this issue, thanks for bringing it up
2014-04-18 21:54:24	frew	tarruda: I can wait for that to give you my full name and URL
2014-04-18 21:54:29	frew	if there were a UI I
2014-04-18 21:54:38	frew	'd gladly put it there so you can do this all at once
2014-04-18 21:57:11	renodesper	frew: is there any page about plugins which already running in neovim?
2014-04-18 21:58:12	frew	renodesper: the new plugin system in incomplete and thus most plugins do not work if they use python, ruby, etc

2014-04-18 22:01:23	frew	renodesper: yep; same here.  just gotta let tarruda et al make more progress :)
2014-04-18 22:04:36	tarruda	renodesper: I hope to get python plugins working by the end of the next week

2014-04-18 22:14:22	raichoo	I hope that neovim succeds, if it does I would probably look at emacs with a lot less envy ^^

2014-04-18 22:19:11	frew	raichoo: same
2014-04-18 22:19:24	frew	raichoo: though, having tried emacs for a little over a month, I can't really take it seriously
2014-04-18 22:19:56	frew	raichoo: ie, they may have a powerful backing programming language, but without a consensus on how to turn on absolute line numbers, you are hardly an editor
2014-04-18 22:20:07	raichoo	frew: yep, same here. I can take it seriously though. It's just not my cup of tea. I still have to use it whenever I'm programming in Agda though :/
2014-04-18 22:20:43	frew	heh

2014-04-18 22:22:09	raichoo	emacs has some great features though. Having multiple clients that connect to a server and share buffers between them is only one.
2014-04-18 22:24:40	frew	raichoo: right; well a more mutable (ie legible, etc) codebase might make that a patch worth adding to neovim :)
2014-04-18 22:25:52	raichoo	frew: From what I understand the new UI infrastructure should give us something like that for free.
2014-04-18 22:26:32	frew	raichoo: hm.  I know it splits it into a client server model, but I didn't realize multiple clients would "just work"
2014-04-18 22:26:54	frew	raichoo: I suspect it could be made to work with multiple clients, but cleint server does not always imply multiple clients per server
2014-04-18 22:27:14	raichoo	I'm just guessing here. Should be possible though ^^
2014-04-18 22:27:46	-->	s-mage has joined #neovim
2014-04-18 22:27:49	frew	should be indeed.
2014-04-18 22:28:01	frew	I'm looking forward to a really performant UI
2014-04-18 22:28:06	raichoo	If neovim reaches a usable state the first thing I'll do is to hack on better idris support :D
2014-04-18 22:28:08	raichoo	Same here
2014-04-18 22:28:17	frew	eg of you turn on cursorline and cursorcolumn and move all ove rthe place
2014-04-18 22:28:20	frew	the UI noticably lags
2014-04-18 22:28:23	-->	ArneL has joined #neovim
2014-04-18 22:28:27	frew	idris?
2014-04-18 22:28:45	raichoo	A programming language with dependent types.
2014-04-18 22:29:05	frew	but you mean like, syntax highlighting etc?
2014-04-18 22:29:24	raichoo	Syntax highlighting, indentation and interactive editing.
2014-04-18 22:29:52	raichoo	Some of the interactive stuff is already present but the new plugin infrastructure should make more stuff possible.
2014-04-18 22:33:04	-->	jonas_buet has joined #neovim
2014-04-18 22:35:59	raichoo	I'd love to have something like semantic highlighting like in agda-mode that works on the fly. But first things first ^^

2014-04-18 22:37:14	s-mage	Hey there. I have a silly question. I cloned neovim repo, run make, then sudo make install, copy .vimrc to .nvimrc and .vim to .nvim and neovim almost works. But I have two issues:
2014-04-18 22:37:14	s-mage	1. It can't find syntax file (because it's somewhere else): E484: Can't open file /usr/local/share/vim/syntax/syntax.vim
2014-04-18 22:37:14	s-mage	2. It swears on codepad plugin:

2014-04-18 22:39:55	s-mage	2 is probably a bug, 1 -- i just want to now, how to fix it and got my syntax highlighting worked, maybe just lame default settings
